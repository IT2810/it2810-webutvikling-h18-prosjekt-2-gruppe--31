"content" : "How sweet the answer Echo makes\nTo music at night,\nWhen, roused by lute or horn, she wakes,\nAnd far away, o'er lawns and lakes,\nGoes answering light.\nYet Love hath echoes truer far,\nAnd far more sweet,\nThan e'er beneath the moonlight star,\nOf horn or lute, or soft guitar,\nThe songs repeat.\n'Tis when the sigh, in youth sincere,\nAnd only then,--\nThe sigh that's breath'd for one to hear,\nIs by that one, that only dear,\nBreathed back again!"
