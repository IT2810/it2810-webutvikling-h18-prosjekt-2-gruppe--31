"content" : "Ah, who is this with twinkling feet,\nWith glad, young eyes and laughter sweet,\nWho tosses back her strong, wild hair,\nAnd saucy kisses flings to Care,\nThe while she laughs at her? Beware—\nYou who this winsome maiden meet!\nShe dances on a daisied throne,\nAbout her waist a slender zone\nOf dandelion’s gold; her eyes\nAre softer than the summer skies,\nAnd blue as violets; and lies\nA tearful laughter in her tone.\nShe reaches dimpled arms and bare;\nHer breath is sweet as wild-rose air;\nShe sighs, she smiles, she glances down,\nHer brows meet in a sudden frown;\nShe laughs; then tears the violets drown—\nIf you should meet her—ah, beware!"
